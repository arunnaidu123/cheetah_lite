The following depndency use git subtrees for remote dependency management.
To update them you will need to use git subtree commands.

cbf-psr-interface
=================
update to latest version:

    git subtree pull --prefix thirdparty/cbf-psr-interface https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/cbf-psr-interface.git master --squash

to push any local changes back to the repo:

    git subtree pull --prefix thirdparty/cbf-psr-interface https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/cbf-psr-interface.git master --squash

after pushing changes, you may not be able to pull again. To fix this you need to remove the subtree and re-add.

git rm -r thirdparty/cbf-psr-interface
git commit -m "remove cbf-psr-interface for reset"
git subtree add --prefix thirdparty/cbf-psr-interface https://gitlab.com/ska-telescope/cbf-psr-interface.git master --squash

boost
=====
this is not a full boost library but some required features that we can use when faced with older boost system libraries
