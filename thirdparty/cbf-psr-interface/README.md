===============

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/ska-telescope-low-cbf-pss-interface/badge/?version=latest)](https://developer.skatelescope.org/projects/low-cbf-pss-interface/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Shared communications interface between CBF and PSS/PST (collectively "PSR").

The source of definitions is the C++ struct, used directly by PSS.  
CBF will use VHDL derived from this file via a Python script.
